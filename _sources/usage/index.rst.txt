EMC^2 Usage guide
=================

EMC^2 was built with the intent that scientists can do comparisons of any SCM microphysical data with
a variety of instrumentation. Therefore, EMC^2 is based around two Python objects, the **Model** and
**Instrument** objects. Before simulated instrument parameters can be generated, both objects must be constructed.
