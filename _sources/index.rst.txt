Welcome to EMC²'s documentation!
=================================

The Earth Model Column Collaboratory (EMC²; Silber et al., under review) is an open-source
framework for conducting intercomparisons between columns from climate and earth system
models and observations from remote sensing instruments such as radars and lidars.

EMC² is inspired from past work comparing remotely-sensed zenith-pointing measurements
to climate models and their single-column model modes (SCMs) (e.g., Bodas-Salcedo et al.,
2008; Lamer, 2018; Swales et al, 2018).

EMC² provides an open source software framework to:

1. Represent both ARM measurements and GCM columns in the Python programming language
building on the Atmospheric Community Toolkit (ACT, Theisen et. al. 2019) and leveraging 
the EMC² team’s success with Py-ART (Helmus and Collis 2016).

2. Scale GCM outputs (using the cloud fraction) to compare with sub-grid-scale column
measurements using a modular sub column generator designed to run off-line on time series
extracted from existing GCM/SCM output.

3. Enable a suite of comparisons between ARM (and other) column measurements and the
GCM model subcolumns.

Detailed description will soon be provided in a dedicated manuscript (Silber et al., in prep).
